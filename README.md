# Employee Segmentation and Retention Analysis

## Description

This project aims to better understand a company's different segments of employees and how to increase employee retention within each segment. We will use clustering techniques to segment the employees, dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize the segments, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to make recommendations for increasing retention.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to understand the different segments of employees within the company and to provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention within each segment.

## Scope

- Use clustering techniques to segment employees.
- Utilize dimensionality reduction techniques for visualizing the segments.
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the clusters to understand their characteristics.
- Make data-driven recommendations to enhance employee retention.

## Sections

### Data Prep & EDA

In this section, we will prepare the data and perform initial exploratory data analysis to understand the key features and characteristics of the dataset.

### K-Means Clustering

We will apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the employees into distinct groups based on their attributes.

### PCA for Visualization

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, allowing us to visualize the clusters in a 2D space.

### K-Means Clustering (Round 2)

Based on the initial analysis and results, we will perform a second round of K-Means clustering to refine the segmentation of employees.

### PCA for Visualization (Round 2)

We will use PCA again to visualize the refined clusters, ensuring better interpretability and understanding of the employee segments.

### EDA on Clusters

In this section, we will conduct detailed exploratory data analysis on the clusters to uncover insights and patterns within each segment of employees.

### Make Recommendations

Based on the findings from the EDA, we will provide actionable recommendations to the company to help increase employee retention within each segment.
